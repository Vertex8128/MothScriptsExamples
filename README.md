# MothScriptsExamples

Please review examples of the game script:

Hero Controllers
I implemented a set of controllers designed to separate the functionality and logic of the main character
Moving Controllers: navigation, rotation, and interaction with different surfaces.
Interaction Controllers: interactions with diverse objects, update hero stats.
Visual Controllers: manages animations and effects.
Equipment Controllers: management of weapon and artifact data.
 
Enemy AI System
This system allows for the customization of enemy movement, chasing, retreating patterns, attack types, number of projectiles, etc.
 
Utilities
Here you'll find my implementation of the Observer pattern and the Timer class which allows you to set delay and repeatedly call functions in non-MonoBehaviour classes. Additionally, there's a static Utils class, offering math, 3D math, and random functionality.
